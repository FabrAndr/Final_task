## Structer

***This app*** has been developed by Fabritsius Andrey, the student of Geekbrain. the task of this app sort of string elements from array by its length, take out all element with 2 or less charms.

*The structere* of this app is composed of few elements:

- **The sorting function:** which take out elements with 3 or more charms from original array to new array.
- **The presenting function:** it's simple, just for show of our array.
- **and a few lines of code without function:** we need to create our massive, if i had thought about this function some time before, i would have did do this, but that's life.

  ## What have we used by.

  1. void showstring(string[] str)
  2. string[] sort(string[] massive)
  3. string[] column
